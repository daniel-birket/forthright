Module testing is performed by 'include'ing the module, then calling
the module with various parameters. The output is initially checked
manually and the validated output saved as a <name>.cmp file for later
comparison. Subsequent test output is compared to the validated
output, automatically.

* Test Runner Script

#+begin_src bash :tangle run-test.bash :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/bash
  bn=$(basename $1 .in)
  echo Testing $bn "..."
  gforth < $bn.in | diff $bn.cmp -
#+end_src

* Run All Tests Script

#+begin_src bash :tangle run-all.bash :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/bash
  for test in *.in; do
      ./run-test.bash $test || exit 1
  done
  echo All Tests Passed
#+end_src
