* Forthright

This repository contains a few small samples of Forth software that I
personally found interesting to write to experiment with the language
and with creating simple automated test scripts. I wrote these scraps
of code with only a few hours of exposure to Forth. If you have only
just encountered Forth, you may find these examples briefly
interesting, but you will frankly find much more useful source code
elsewhere.
